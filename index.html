        <h1>A Poem for Nagham</h1>
        <div class="poem">
            <p>In a garden where the roses bloom,<br>
            Lives a girl with a heart of gold,<br>
            Her name is Nagham, a sweet tune,<br>
            A story of love and joy untold.</p>
            
            <p>With eyes that sparkle like the stars,<br>
            And a smile that lights up the night,<br>
            Nagham dances under the moon,<br>
            Her spirit shining so bright.</p>
            
            <p>Her laughter is the melody,<br>
            That fills the world with cheer,<br>
            In her presence, hearts are warm,<br>
            She is cherished, she is dear.</p>
            
            <p>Oh Nagham, you're a symphony,<br>
            Of grace, of hope, of dreams,<br>
            May your days be ever joyful,<br>
            Flowing like gentle streams.</p>
